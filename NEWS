CHANGES IN VERSION 2.0
------------------------
NEW FEATURES
    o The networks can now be plotted for terms in addition to genes.
    o In the report, clicking on the plots allows to see the plot at full size next to the terms table (if the screen resolution allows it).
    o ToMatrix(): Added arguments 'key' (to choose either genes or terms) and 'removeFiltered' terms. Renamed main argument (geneTermSets) to 'results'.
    o IntersectionNetwork() shows a warning if there is no intersection. Added argument 'plotAllMg' to allow choosing wether to plot unconnected metagroups or not.
    o FunctionalNetwork() changed the two main arguments to a single one, which is the raw output from toMatrix() (a list with names: c("metagroupsMatrix", "gtSetsMatrix", "filteredOut")). Added arguments: 'eColor' to provide the edges color, and 'weighted' to draw the edge width according to the number of shared gene-term sets.
    o Reports: Added argument 'downloadGOtree' to allow choosing wether to download the go term trees png (slower) or just provide the link to the web tool.
    
BUG FIXES
    o functionalNetwork() now correctly  writes either "cl" or "mg" in the legend

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.3.1
------------------------
NEW FEATURES
    o adjMatrix() has been renamed to toMatrix()

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2
------------------------

    o Query David through web service (RDAVIDWebService): Avoids limitations of API interface
    o Added argument KeepColors to functionalNetwork and intersectionNetwork: Keeps the same color for each group even if some are filtered out. 
    o Added argument geneLabels to getResults_david: Allows to replace the IDs for a gene name/symbol in the plots
    
BUG FIXES
    o Minor bug fixes
    
CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.1
------------------------
BUG FIXES
